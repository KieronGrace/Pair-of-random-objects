# Pair-of-random-objects
Challenge was to use Java to create a class which instantiates and object which holds two objects of any type. Using generics, this class can take arguments of any type and instantiate a pair. The test class shows that the pair can hold objects of any type and those objects may be overwritten with a new object of any type using the setFirst() or setSecond() methods.
